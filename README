This driver and library has been ported to run with 64 bit kernels, and most compiler and  valgrind warnings
have been removed.

It has been tested on CentOS 7.1, with kernel 3.10.0

The ioctl() and mmap() functions have been revised using example code from ldt, 
https://github.com/makelinux/ldt.git .

This is the driver for IOTECH DaqBoard 1000 and 2000 Series that runs on Linux kernel 3.13.

This driver has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with kernel 3.13.0-27. This driver might work with Ubuntu 12.04 as well (or with other version between 12.04 - 14.04).

The original driver for kernel 2.4 is found here: ftp://ftp.mccdaq.com/downloads/iotech_software/DaqBoard_1000_2000_Series/


------------------------ Tested Features ------------------

1. Some ADC sample apps are working (Sample apps: bin/DaqAdcEx02, bin/DaqAdcEx07, bin/DaqAdcEx10, bin/DaqAdcEx11).
2. ADC application bin/DaqAdcEx04 appear to be working (It waits for TTL input which I didn't test with)
3. Some ADC sample apps are not working (Sample apps: bin/DaqAdcEx03, bin/DaqAdcEx05, bin/DaqAdcEx06, bin/DaqAdcEx08)
   * There seems to be a memory mapping issue in the driver which I may fix in future if I find a need.
4. Digital IO appears to be working (Sample apps bin/DaqDigIOEx01 and bin/DaqDigIOEx02 are running well). I didn't test with inputs/outputs.
5. Digital timer outputs are working (Sample apps: bin/DaqTmrEx01). Waveforms were observed via an oscilloscope.
6. DAC features of the driver has not been tested since my card DaqBoard 1005 does not have DAC.


------------------------ Install --------------------------
A) To copile, run

  $ make


B) To install the driver, library for client programs and headerfiles, run

  $ sudo make install


C) To load the driver, either run 'modprobe db2k' or run

  $ sudo make load


D) To run sample applications, execute the binaries round inside bin directory. For example,

  $ bin/DaqXXXX


The old readme file (old.daqboard2000.readme) packaged with this has some details about the sample applications that you might be interested in reading.


------------------------ Loading the driver at boot time --------------------------

If you want the driver to load at boot time, use a udev rule or /etc/rc.local file to execute the following commands:

  mkdir -p /dev/db2k
  mknod -m 0666 /dev/db2k/DaqBoard2K0 c 61 0
  mknod -m 0666 /dev/db2k/DaqBoard2K1 c 61 1
  mknod -m 0666 /dev/db2k/DaqBoard2K2 c 61 2
  mknod -m 0666 /dev/db2k/DaqBoard2K3 c 61 3 
  modprobe db2k

The execution of the above modprobe command creates /proc/iotech/.../type files. You can 'cat /proc/iotech/.../type' files. If it prints 35, the driver has detected a DaqBoard 1005 card. 0 indicates no card.


------------------------ Testing --------------------------

Press CTRL+ALT+F1 (F2,F2...) and switch to a console. Login as root user. Before modprobe command is run, run the following:

  echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk

Now load the driver:

  modprobe db2k

This should print some messages to the console as the driver is loaded.

Alternatively, look at the /var/log/syslog file.
